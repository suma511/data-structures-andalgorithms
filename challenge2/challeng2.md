# insert in to the middle of an array 
we have to create an array with a length related to the inputs of the user 
we take the inputs and insert them to the array then if the user went to insert an item the item will be inserted to the middle of the array

we use for loop and an input command to fill the array i see thats an effcient way to inser an item we used round ceil to get the middle location
